# Loan-Repayment-Predictiion-with-Neural-Networks
This project marks my initial exploration into machine learning, focusing on the application of neural networks and classification techniques in loan data analysis. Using a dataset of over 9,500 loans, the project investigates borrower characteristics, loan structures, and repayment outcomes to predict whether loans are fully paid back
